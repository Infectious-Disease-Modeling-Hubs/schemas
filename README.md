# Modeling Hub Schemas

This repository houses JSON schemas for [the Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs). These schemas define the specifications for the configuration files that are required to be present in a modeling hub. Full documentation about modeling hubs can be found at [the Modeling Hub documentation site](https://hubdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), with some [specific documentation about the schema files](https://hubdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format/hub-metadata.html).

# Versioning
Schemas will be directly versioned, with different versions living in different folders in the root directory of the repo with a name as `vx.x.x.x` (for example, `v0.0.0.1`). Any finalized change to any of the three schema files that is added to the main branch will result in the addition of a new set of all schema files.
